# Code Repository for Adversarial Transferability in Wearable Sensor Systems

## Datasets

1. [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/240/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones)
2. [MHEALTH](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/319/mhealth+dataset)
3. [Activity of Daily Living](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/research/projects/activity-recognition/#dataset_dailylog)

## Codebase

Each Jupyter Notebook file is for one case of transferability discussed in the paper. The cases are

1. Transferability between models
2. Transferability across sensor locations
3. Transferability across subjects
4. Transferability between datasets

### Environment

Experiments were conducted using the TensorFlow and CleveHans libraries. We have provied an yml file (**envTF1_15**) to help create the environment used in the analysis.

### Processed Dataset

Processed datasets are also provided in the **Processed Data** directory. 

### Results

All the results from the experiments are present in the **Results** directory.
